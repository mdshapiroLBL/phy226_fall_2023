    "In order to understand how their detectors respond, particle physicists use complex simulations.  These simulations take as their input Monte Carlo generated events, propagate the particles in these events through a model of the detector and simulate the response.  The output of the simulation is written in the same format as the real data and is used to understand the experiment's acceptance and resolution. Proper modeling of the detector response requires detailed understanding of the physics of particle interactions with matter.  Today, most experiments use a simulation toolkit, called Geant4, to model this physics. In this problem, you will write your own Monte Carlo simulation of electromagnetic showers and use it to describe shower development in the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL).
