Once you complete your analysis, write up your results in the form of a technical paper much like you would see in physics journals such as the Physical Review Letters (PRL). Please use LaTeX to write your report. A template for a sample PRL write-up can be found at https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/revtex-4-dot-2-template-and-sample/yydsrzvrqrzs  This template is encouraged, but it is not required. If you cannot access this Overleaf, please contact Prof Shapiro. Make sure that all plots in your paper have legends, axis labels, titles, and figure numbers, and make sure to cite all of your technical sources properly.  Your paper should include an abstract, an introduction describing the goals of your work, a brief description of the experiment used to collect the data, a discussion of the analysis itself and section presenting your conclusions.  You will lose points if you do not explicitly have all these sections in your writeup.\n",

This means you may not share code, TEX files (besides templates), or any plots that you include in your paper and the wording of the text must be your own. \n",

While there are no strict length requirement, a paper of length 3 or 4 pages with a few figures and/or tables is appropriate.  Your grade on this project will be based on this write-up.  You need not submit your Jupyter notebook.\n",
