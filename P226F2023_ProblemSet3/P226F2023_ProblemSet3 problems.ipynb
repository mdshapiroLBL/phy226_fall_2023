The largest momentum for which the two hypothesis can be distinguished depends on $\\sigma_c$. Scientists use the term confidence level to describe how well we can tell two hypothesis apart  A 90\\%\\ confidence level separation means that it we start with equal populations in the two possibilities, we will choose the wrong hypothesis 10\\%\\ of the time. See, for example, the PDG review of statistics Figure 40.4 and Table 40.1.  From that table, you learn that a 90\\%\\ confidence level separation corresponds to  $1.64 \\sigma$ for a two-sided cut. Here, however, we are doing something slightly different.  If we have two Gaussians where one is centered at $\\theta=0$ and the other is centered at $\\theta=n\\sigma$ then the natural way to assign particles by species is to say all the measurements with $\\theta>n\\sigma/2$ belong to the Gaussian centered at $\\theta=n\\sigma$ and the others belong to the Gaussian centered at $\\theta=0$.  The probability of getting the wrong assignment with this strategty is called a one-sided confidence limit.  In our case, we must ask that $10\\% $ of the events be in one tail (so\n",

Also assume that the electronics has an intrinsic noise contribution $\\sigma_N=0.05$~MIP. (This means that the measurement of the charge on each strip is modified by adding a noise contribution that is distributed according to a Gaussian with mean 0 and variance $\\sigma_N$.)

    "Physicists often fit for signals in the presence of background.  In such cases, the significance of the fitted signal depends not only on the number of signal events but also on the amount of background and our ability to statistically separate the two.  In this problem, we will explore fitting signal and background for a very simple case:  The signal is a Gaussian peak centered at $x=10$ with a width $\\sigma=1$ and the background is uniformly distributed between $x=0$ and $x=20$.  The code below generates fake data, allowing you to change both the number of events in the signal and the ratio of signal-to-background.  To make sure that our definition of background does not depend on the fit range, the code below defines the signal-to-background ratio as the ratio number of signal events to the number of background events in a $\\pm 2 \\sigma$ window around the signal peak.  Here is the code you will use to generate the fake data:"
