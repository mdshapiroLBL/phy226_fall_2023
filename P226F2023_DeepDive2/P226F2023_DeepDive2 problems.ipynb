    "# Physics 226 Fall 2023 Deep Dive 2: Beta Decay\n",
    "\n",
    "Beta decay is a nuclear decay process in which an unstable nucleus decays into a less massive one by emitting a beta particle. Beta decay plays a crucial role in the dynamics of radioactive elements and contributes to the conversion of elements within stars through nuclear reactions. It is also important in the context of particle physics, helping to uncover fundamental properties of subatomic particles. \n",

    "Here, we will use the beta decay spectrum of tritium as a model to investigate the many features of beta decay theory, experimental considerations, and the statistical framework needed to claim a discovery."

    "### 1a. Beta Decay Spectrum for a Massive Neutrino\n",
    "\n",
    "In section, we derived the shape of the distribution of electron kinetic energy,$T_e$, for beta decay in the limit of a massless neutrino. To derive this, we start in the rest frame of the parent nucleus. We assume that the three-momenta of the daughter nucleus ($\\vec{p_N}$), electron ($\\vec{p_e}$), and (anti)neutrino ($\\vec{p_\\nu}$) are all non-nelgigible. This means that the electron and (anti)neutrino can each be omitted in any direction; momentum conservation can always be enforced by setting $\\vec{p_N} = \\vec{p_e} + \\vec{p_\\nu}$. We next assume that since $m_N >> m_e$, the kinetic energy of the nucleus is negligible. Therefore, energy conservation implies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T_e + T_\\nu =  M_p - M_d - m_e \\equiv Q$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T_i$ is the kinetic energy of particle $i$, $M_p$ is the mass of the parent nucleus, $M_d$ is the mass of the daughter nucleus. Note that we have defined the \"Q-value\" of the decay as the total _kinetic_ energy in the system after the decay. This is a fixed quantity for a given beta-decaying nucleus. (As a side-note, there are some rare isotopes which can either single- or double-beta decay. In this case, the two Q-values will be different, and the phase space factor for the double beta decay will also look very different.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the beta decay rate, we use Fermi's golden rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Gamma_{i\\rightarrow f} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar}|{\\langle i | \\mathcal{M} | f \\rangle}|^2 \\iint dN_\\nu dN_e \\delta(Q - T_e - T_\\nu)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to transform the factors of $dN_i$ into factors of $dT_i$. We do this using the standard statistical mechanics approach of considering the density of states for a discrete lattice of states in a box of volume $V$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$dN = \\frac{4\\pi V}{(2\\pi \\hbar)^3} p^2 dp$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The neutrino transformation is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ dT_\\nu = dp_\\nu $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The electron transformation is a bit more annoying:\n",
    "\n",

    "p_e &= \\sqrt{T_e^2 + 2m_e T_e}\\\\\n",
    "dp_e &= dT_e \\frac{T_e + m_e}{\\sqrt{T_e^2 + 2m_e T_e}}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging all of this into Fermi's golden rule, we can replace all instances of $T_\\nu$ with $Q - T_e$ by integrating out $\\delta(Q - T_e - T_\\nu) dT\\nu$. The final decay rate is thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Gamma_{i\\rightarrow f} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar}|{\\langle i | \\mathcal{M} | f \\rangle}|^2 \\frac{16\\pi^2 V^2}{(2\\pi \\hbar)^6}\\int_0^Q dT_e \\left(Q-T_e\\right)^2\\left(T_e+m_e\\right)\\sqrt{T_e^2+2m_e T_e} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this integral, you would find that the total decay rate scales as $Q^5$. This result is known as Sargent's rule and it is useful to keep in mind during isotope selection for an experiment. Here, we are specifically interested in the electron kinetic energy spectrum, so we take the derivative with respect to $T_e$. Grouping all of the constants into a power of an effective energy scale $\\Lambda$, we have:\n",

    "**Question:** Conduct a similar calculation, or make a sufficiently compelling argument, to show that the spectrum of the electron kinetic energy in the case of a massive neutrino is:\n",

This is a helpful way to keep Q fixed as we vary the neutrino mass, but still enforce an effective endpoint of $Q - m_\\nu$.*"

    "### 1c. The Fermi Function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of beta decay: beta-minus ($\\beta^-$) and beta-plus ($\\beta^+$). In beta-minus decay, a neutron is converted into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. In beta-plus decay, a proton is transformed into a neutron, a positron, and a neutrino. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our above work, for a given nuclear matrix element, the lepton kinetic energy spectra should look identical for ($\\beta^-$) and ($\\beta^+$) decay. However, this is not what we observe in nature. The primary explanation for this is the electromagnetic interaction between the emitted charged particle and the nucleus via the Coulomb potential. This interaction shifts the positron spectrum to higher energies relative to the electron spectrum. In addition, there is a quantum mechanical effect due to the classically disallowed region of the positron wavefunction due to the electromagnetic potential. This suppresses the low-energy end of the positron spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe these effects, we define the *Fermi function* as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F^{\\pm}(y) = \\frac{2\\pi y}{1 - e^{-2\\pi y}}, \\hspace{16pt} y = \\mp \\alpha Z_{daughter} \\frac{E_e}{p_e} = \\mp \\alpha Z_{daughter} \\frac{T_e + m_e}{\\sqrt{T_e^2 + 2m_e T_e}} $$\n",

We will address the addition of backgrounds in problem 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a typical experiment, we hope to have small, but inevitably non-negligible numbers of background events in the data. To include the presence of background events in our model, we need to define the *background index.* The background index is typically expressed in units of counts/Energy/exposure. Exposure is a vague term, but we'll come back to it later. In the simple case of a flat background, the number of observed counts at any particular energy is the same, so the total number of counts must scale linearly with the width of our energy axis, $\\Delta E$. We also assume that the number of background counts scales linearly with the live time of the detector, $t$. In total this gives us: $N_{background} \\propto t \\Delta E$. This constant of proportionality is called the *background index*: $$b \\equiv \\frac{N_{background}}{t\\Delta E}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is popular to normalize the background index by dividing by the mass of the detector or sample. Our number of background counts can be normalized by either $t$ or $Mt$ where $M$ is the mass of the detector, so you will often see this value reported in units of counts/keV/kg/yr. We will later roll in the mass normalization.\n",

    "$$ N_{signal} = N_0 ( 1 - e^{-\\Gamma t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the limit that the live-time of the experiment is small compared to $1/\\Gamma$, then the number of beta decays during the experiment is simply $N_0 t \\Gamma $, where $N_0$ is the starting number of tritium nuclei. We know that the half-life is 12.32 years, so the decay rate is $\\Gamma = 1.78\\times10^{-19} s^{-1}$. Considering only events with $T_e < Q$, we have:\n",
