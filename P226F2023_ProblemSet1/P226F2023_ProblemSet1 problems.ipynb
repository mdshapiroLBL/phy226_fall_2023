    "In Classical Mechanics, the *Lagrangian* is a useful quantity that helps encapsulate the dynamics of a system via the Euler-Lagrange equations. In a classical system, the Lagrangian can often be expressed as $$ L = T - V$$ where $T$ is the kinetic energy of the system and $V$ is the potential energy of the system.

Thus, we should re-write the action as an integral over all four space-time dimensions.

    "In this course, we will later examine the equations governing relativistic particle dynamics in detail. For now, you will have to take them as a given. Recall that there exist two categories of elementary particles: fermions, with half-integer spin, and bosons, with integer spin. In particle physics, we take the perspective that particles are really excitations of fields which exist throughout all of space-time. Let's start with the simplest quantum field - a scalar field. At every point in space-time $x^\\mu$, this field takes on a real value, $\\phi(x^\\mu)$. Since this is a scalar field, and spin is a vector quantity, this field must represent a spin 0 particle, a so-called \"scalar boson.\" The Lagrangian of this field is:  $$\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{\\nabla}\\phi)^2 -\\frac{1}{2} m^2\\phi^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_\\mu\\phi\\partial_\\nu\\phi -\\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}$ is the Minkowski metric Diag\\{1,-1,-1,-1\\} and $\\mu,\\nu$ parameterize the 4 space-time indices over which we sum. **What are the dimensions of this scalar field? Use the Euler-Lagrange Equations to vary the action and find the equation of motion for this scalar field. What familiar partial differential equation does this look like?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation of motion you derived is known as the Klein-Gordon Equation. Fun fact: Schr\\\"odinger actually came up with this equation when he tried to make his theory relativistic, but he did not publish it!\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, fermions, which are required to have non-zero spin, are represented mathematically as \\textit{spinor} fields. This means that every point in space-time is associated with a 4-dimensional \"spinor,\" which is similar to a vector but with some particular transformation properties. The Lagrangian for fermions looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L} = i\\overline{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi - m\\overline{\\psi}{\\psi}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\gamma^\\mu$ is a set of 4 different $4\\times4$ matrices and the $\\mu$ represents the 4 space-time indices that we sum over. For our purposes, you can just treat them as unitless numbers. **What are the dimensions of this fermion field? Use the Euler-Lagrange equations to find the equation of motion for this fermion field. Hint: Vary the action with respect to $\\bar{\\psi}$ to give you an equation of motion for $\\psi$.**\n",

    "Let us now explore a real particle interaction. We will start with what we call an \"effective field theory.\" At sufficiently low energies, this theory is sufficient to describe the interaction, however it breaks down at higher energies. The (arguably) most well-known example of an effective field theory is Fermi's Theory of Beta decay. In this theory, a neutron decays into a proton and an electron as well as a light, neutral electron *anti-neutrino.* See the corresponding Feynman diagram [here](https://https://www.quantumdiaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fourFermi_BetaDecay.png).\n",

    "$$ \\mathcal{L} \\propto (\\overline{u}_p\\gamma_\\mu u_n)(\\overline{u}_e\\gamma^\\mu u_\\overline{\\nu})$$\n",

    "For now, the notation might feel unfamiliar, so let's break it down. We use $u$ and $\\overline{u}$ to represent the spinor fields of the fermions at play. *Spinor fields of incoming anti-particles and outgoing particles get bars over the $u$'s. Spinor fields of incoming particles and outgoing anti-particles do not get bars.* The subscripts $p, n, e, \\overline{\\nu}$ refer to the proton, neutron, electron, and anti-neutrino respectively. The $\\gamma$'s again refer to a set of 4 $\\times$ 4 matrices, and the $\\mu$ still represents the 4 space-time indices that we sum over. **Using what you know about fermion fields, what must the dimension of the constant of proportionality be in the Fermi theory?** This constant of proportionality is called the Fermi constant, and it is quite important in Weak interaction physics."

    "Repeat the above question, but this time based on a triangular bounding distribution $f(x) \\propto \\min[x,1-x]$ over $0 \\le x \\le 1$, draw $n = 10^6$ variates, hopefully based on an optimal choice of $c$. (HINT:  you can draw variates from the triangular distribution by using a transformation method with piecewise mapping, or by considering the sum of two uniform variates.  For fun, you may want to explore both to see which is faster---the former requires an if-then test, which slows down modern computers, while the latter requires drawing two deviates).\n",

    "Is the improved constant $c$ in this context worth the extra effort required to generate triangular rather than uniform trial deviates?  "
